"Abstract"
"Purpose CFTR mutations not only cause cystic fibrosis, but also increase the risk of colorectal cancer. A putative"
"role of CFTR in colorectal cancer patients without cystic fibrosis has so far, however, not been investigated. RAC3"
"is a nuclear receptor coactivator that has been found to be overexpressed in several human tumors, and to be"
"required for maintaining cancer stemness. Here, we investigated the functional relationship between CFTR and"
"RAC3 for maintaining cancer stemness in human colorectal cancer."
"Methods Cancer stemness was investigated by analysing the expression of stem cell markers, clonogenic growth and"
"selective retention of fluorochrome, using stable transfection of shCFTR or shRAC3 in HCT116 colorectal cancer"
"cells. In addition, we performed pathway enrichment and network analyses in both primary human colorectal cancer"
"samples (TCGA, Xena platform) and Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells including (1) CD133+ or CD133- side popula-"
"tions and (2) CFTRwt or CFTRmut cells (ConsensusPathDB, STRING, Cytoscape, GeneMANIA)."
"Results We found that the CD133+ side population expresses higher levels of RAC3 and CFTR than the CD133-"
"side population. RAC3 overexpression increased CFTR expression, whereas CFTR downregulation inhibited the"
"cancer stem phenotype. CFTR mRNA levels were found to be increased in colorectal cancer samples from patients"
"without cystic fibrosis compared to those with CFTR mutations, and this correlated with an increased expression of"
"RAC3. The expression pattern of a gene set involved in inflammatory response and nuclear receptor modulation in"
"CD133+ Caco-2 cells was found to be shared with that in CFTRwt Caco-2 cells. These genes may contribute to"
"colorectal cancer development."
"Conclusions CFTR may play a non-tumor suppressor role in colorectal cancer development and maintenance involv-"
"ing enhancement of the expression of a set of genes related to cancer stemness and development in patients without"
"CFTR mutations."
